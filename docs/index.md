This website documents what we did and what we learned.

## Overview

A PostgreSQL database schema consisting of 14 tables with some populated data was given to us. This database is modeled on how Numpy Ninja runs-- It has programs for Data Science/Machine Learning, and SDETs, with batches of professionals in each program.

We were given 90 queries to write, as a team, in the span of **exactly** one week, from a Tuesday evening to the next Tuesday evening. Bonus points would be given for writing extra queries and following Agile Methodologies.

We cannot share more details about the database schema or the questions that were asked and our answers as that is proprietary.

However, we can share our presentation and blogs that we wrote.

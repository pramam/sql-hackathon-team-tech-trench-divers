This website documents what we did and what we learned.

## Overview

A PostgreSQL database schema consisting of 14 tables with some populated data was given to us. This database(Learning Management System-DB, LMS_DB) is modeled on how Numpy Ninja runs-- It has programs for Data Science/Machine Learning, and SDETs, with batches of professionals in each program.

Take a look at the Entity Relationship Diagram (ER-Diagram) below:

We were given 90 queries to write, as a team, in the span of **exactly** one week, from a Tuesday evening to the next Tuesday evening. Bonus points would be given for writing extra queries and following Agile Methodologies.
